# Fleet-Management-Panel-Mobile-App
Fleet management panel &amp; mobile app product project for a fast delivery operation with approximately 20k vehicles
# Vehicle Management System Project at Getir

## Project Overview
During my tenure at Getir, our operations spanned Turkey, the USA, and seven European countries, relying heavily on our fleet of motorcycles, bicycles, and cars, which served nearly 20,000 couriers. However, we faced significant challenges as there was no tracking for vehicle registrations, usage data, maintenance costs, depreciation measurements, or rental expenses. Additionally, mileage data was crucial for our revenue model.

To address this, we initiated a project to create a web panel in collaboration with a software company. I joined the project as the Product Manager after the initial screens were designed and the panel was created.

## My Role
As the Product Manager, I took ownership of the project and managed all stakeholders, including global fleet managers, the software companyâ€™s developers and CTO, our product and data teams, and business analysts. I was responsible for collecting development requests from global fleet managers, assessing their feasibility for the panel, prioritizing tasks, and planning sprints with the software company.

## Key Responsibilities:
- **Stakeholder Management:** Engaged with all relevant stakeholders, facilitating communication between global fleet teams and the software company to ensure alignment on product requirements.
  
- **Requirement Gathering and Prioritization:** Collected and prioritized development requests from global fleet managers, evaluating their usability for the panel.
  
- **Sprint Planning:** Coordinated with the software company to plan sprints, ensuring timely delivery of features and functionalities.
  
- **Weekly Meetings:** Conducted weekly meetings with global fleet teams to discuss development updates and gather feedback on their needs and challenges.
  
- **Testing and Bug Resolution:** Tested sprint outputs, identifying bugs and working with developers to resolve issues, ensuring a smooth user experience.
  
- **Documentation and Training:** Created comprehensive documentation and training videos in English. Conducted training sessions for each country, educating teams on product usage.
  
- **Mobile Version Development:** After the web panel became functional, collaborated with the software company to develop a mobile version. This version was designed to be simpler and more user-friendly, focusing on screen designs and data inputs.

## Key Achievements
- Successfully implemented a vehicle management system that enabled global teams to track vehicle usage, mileage, activation, mapping, and cost management.
- Facilitated the transition of the global fleet teams to the new system, improving operational efficiency and data reporting capabilities.
- Developed training materials and sessions that ensured a smooth adoption of the new system across multiple countries.

With the completion of this project, we transformed our vehicle management process, allowing us to gather critical data for informed decision-making and operational improvements.
